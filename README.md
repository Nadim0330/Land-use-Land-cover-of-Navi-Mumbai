## Insights
1. Similar water body distributions observed.
2. Kolkata: More vegetation; Navi Mumbai: More built-up area.
3. Kolkata: Evenly distributed agriculture; Navi Mumbai: Clustered agriculture.
4. Navi Mumbai: Extensive built-up area; Kolkata: Less clustered.

## Derived Conclusion
These findings underscore the importance of tailored urban planning strategies and ecosystem management approaches to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by each city's land use dynamics. Policymakers, planners, and stakeholders can leverage this information to inform evidence-based decision-making processes aimed at promoting sustainable urban growth, enhancing environmental resilience, and fostering equitable development outcomes.
